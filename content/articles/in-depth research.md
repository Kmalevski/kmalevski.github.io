## What is stego-malware?
Stegomalware is a type of malware that uses steganography to hinder detection. 

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, video or network traffic.

## Techniques of hiding data 
One of the most popular techniques utilized by adversaries to hide their malware is LSB Encoding.
![LSB](/articles/article-3/lsb_encodinf.png)
> - Image showing how hackers use the least significant bit and modifying it to suit their payload.

LSB encoding is one of the far more simpler techniques that adversaries use to hide data. The technique is executed by modifying the least significant bit of the file. 

By changing the LSB - the adversary keeps the overall metadata of the file untouched

Other techniques include:
- Frequency Domain Steganography: Embedding data within frequency components of media.
- Masking: Concealing information in less noticeable regions of an image.

## Attack vectors
Stegomalware can be distributed using various methods:
![attack](/articles/article-3/attack.png)
#### File embedding
  - Stegomalware uses file embedding to hide the malicious payloads inside files such as images or audio. I covered LSB encoding which is used ro hide the payload but aiming to not change the overall size of the file. The bigger the image, the more useful that will be for the payload

#### Delayed execution
  - In order to stay hidden, adversaries make the payload to either execute with a big delay or execute when a specific event triggers on the victimâ€™s system. Other malware types can also use such tactics but they rely on immediate execution and a lot of them get detected and stopped before being able to do serious damage
![delayed](/articles/article-3/malwarebaazar.webp)
> - Malware samples analyzed using MalwareBazaar in CAPEv2.
- Alot of times stego-malware is used to hide payloads inside the images in order to try and dodge. I used CAPEV2 sandbox to analyse malware that has been used in images like pdf and png. I used MalwareBazaar for downloading the samples and running it in an isolated environment. 
#### Command and control servers (C2)
Hackers use payloads in images to create a reverse TCP connection.

- A reverse shell connects to a C2 by having the payload, once executed on the target system, initiate an outbound connection (e.g., reverse TCP) to the attacker's C2 server, allowing the attacker to interact with the victim's terminal as if they were directly inside the target system.

![alt text](/articles/article-3/cape1.png)
> - the image shows analysis results on pdf malware samples using open-source sandboxing tool CAPEV2
  - The results from a lot of the analyses conducted are that most of the time types of malware when deployed try to interact with the system by spawning additional processes. The samples try to access files and modify registry keys which is a big red flag. That way the payload will most certainly try to disable a key security feature or try to elevate privileges
![cape2](/articles/article-3/cape2.png)
> - During the analysis Acrobat.exe was used to open the .pdf's inside the disposable machines and run the malware.

![cape4](/articles/article-3/cape4.png)
> - Alot of the malware samples when deployed immediately started interacting with the Windows API in order to create fake processes and extract information of the current OS

### Tools
There are various tools that enable us to embed messages or even paylaods inside images.
![Steghide](/articles/article-3/steghide_part1.PNG)
> - using the command line tool steghide to embed a secret message within a image

An example are OpenStego and Steghide which are fairly simple to use.
I played around with it for a while and decided to embed some payloads in images just to see what is the result.

## First attempts at payload embedding
During my research I got more and more interested in Windows AV so I decided that  I will make it my goal to bypass it, if not I will come out with alot of new knowledge about Windows Internals.

I selected Metasploit and Veil in combination to try and confuse the AV and not detect the payload, these were my first attempts in learning how the AV worked so it was not perfect. 

I wanted to simulate a scenario where a user visits a "bad" website, auto-downloads and executes the payload.

> - creating an obfuscated payload using veil and metasploit

![metasploit](/articles/article-3/metasploid_part2.PNG)
> - using the created payload and starting the listener that waits for a connection.

![apache](/articles/article-3/metasploid_part3PNG.PNG)
> - Windows AV blocking the downloading of the file, thus this attempt is unsuccesfull.



However just embedding the executable inside the image will not be enough, since Windows AV static code scanner will block the downloading of the payload.

Plus there is a big issue with the tools I used previously like Open-stego:
- they use the same mechanism for embedding and extracting the images which is something I m not fond of since I want the process of delivery to be automated.

> - OpenStego embedding payload within an image.

## How does AV combat stego?
Anti-virus solutions have traditionally safeguarded users against malware by scanning files against extensive databases of known threats. However, the emergence of stegomalware that conceals itself within seemingly innocuous files like images and PDFsâ€”poses significant challenges for detection and prevention.

  - #### Signature detection
   Traditional AV relies on matching file signatures with known malware databases. However, stegomalwareâ€™s altered signatures often evade detection.
![av2](/articles/article-3/av2.png)
> - Antivirus checking a fileâ€™s signature against its database.
  - #### Dynamic engine
  Dynamic engines monitor file behavior in controlled environments, identifying suspicious activities such as unauthorized API calls or privilege escalations.
![av1](/articles/article-3/av.png)
> - Sandbox environment analyzing potential malware behavior.
### Why is this important?
The combination of dynamic analysis and behavioural analysis helps operators detect zero-day vulnerabilities which is a big neverlasting issue in cyber. 

Using sandboxing as well helps us determine and understand how the malware sample behaves inside the system - even if its a zero-day. 

![evolve](/articles/article-3/evolve.png) 
> - Modern malware adapting to evade detection.
Even though people are currently working on improving AV detection using Machine learning, stego still is a big pain to detect and to eliminate. Malware is constantly evolving and can detect if its being run in a sandbox.

This will result of the malware to become dormant and wait until a specific event executes.

### AMSI,AMSITrigger and hoaxshell
AMSI(anti-malware scanner interface) is a feature in Windows Defender. It was introduced together with the release of W10.

The main purpose of AMSI was to detect if malware has obfuscated it malicious strings. 
With that it became alot harder to bypass the AV with such capabilities.
![AMSI_detection](/articles/article-3/amsitriggerlocal.PNG) 

But adversaries were able to leverage AMSI to create AMSITrigger.
AMSITrigger is a open-source tool which can check your payloads if they contain a string that will be detected by AMSI in Windows.

This is demonstrated the most by using powershell.
![AMSITrigger_check_bad](/articles/article-3/amsitrigger_bad.webp)
> - This payload contains strings that may not be viewed as malicious but they are used against Windows to exploit it.

Then I tested my own scripts and changed some variables inside it and got the following result:
![AMSITrigger_check](/articles/article-3/amsitrigger1.PNG) 
> - The payload gets checked and does not contain bad strings that will be detected by AMSI.

To test if I can establish a shellcode connection to a Windows OS I used another open source tool = Hoaxshell

Hoaxshell is a payload generator specifically built to bypass the AV. 
![Hoaxshell](/articles/article-3/hoaxshell1.PNG) 
- It generates obfuscated/gibberish powershell scripts which then are compiled into one singular program.

I tried deploying the payload ona fully patched W11 machine with defender however it quickly detected what was going on and blocked the whole process.
![W11_defender_block](/articles/article-3/hoaxshellfinal.PNG)
> - Defender blocking the powershell script from execution. 

So for that I spun up a older W10 virtual machine to see if the bypass is possible. 
During the earlier days of W10, AMSI was not that strong since Veil, Metasploit and such tools as Hoaxshell could have been used to easily bypass the Defender.
![local_check_ps](/articles/article-3/amsitrigger2.PNG)
> - I managed to run the powershell script undetected from the AMSI.

![Shell_connection_result](/articles/article-3/hoaxshellS1.PNG)
> - The reverse connection was established therefore I was able to have access to internal files and processes.
> - Since AMSI only works for static code detection, sp modifying your code in advance to confuse the Defender will be the best course of action. 

However nowadays AMSI can recognize if malicious strings are obfuscated and immediately shuts down the process if it is deemed bad.
So exploitation has become more and more difficult.

### Bonus - C2 frameworks
At some point in my research I took an interest in C2 frameworks and what they were for.
C2 frameworks, or command and control frameworks, are tools that allow red teams and threat actors to communicate with and control compromised systems.

Such solutions provide big convinienve to exploitation of a victim and allows groups of people to communicate and to conduct simulated attacks to confirm a payload's behaviour.

I checked out Havoc and had fun with it.
![Havoc1](/articles/article-3/havoc1.PNG)
> - I began by installing the tool, logging in and create HTTP and HTTPS listeners.

Then I proceeded to explore what payloads can Havoc produced
![Havoc2](/articles/article-3/havoc2.PNG)
> - Demon payload can be spawned in EXE, DLL, Shell_code.bin and service.exe
> - I chose the EXE but with some tweaks such as to use EKKO obfuscation technique.

In the past it was possible to exploit a W11 machine with updated defender however nowadays that was not possible since it blocked everything I tried. 

So that's why I again went to an older W10. And it worked!

I was able to initialize connection to the PC, and it continued to working even after restarting the virtual machine.
![Havoc3](/articles/article-3/havoc3.PNG)
![Havoc4](/articles/article-3/havoc4.PNG)
![Havoc1](/articles/article-3/havoc5.PNG)

Generally I had alot of fun and I will be eager to exlpore it more in depth.

### What's next?
My next steps will be to finalise my documentation on my research and present it at the end to my teachers for a final assessment.
